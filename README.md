# JsonDiff
The goal is to create a tool to compare JSON item by item.   
Rather than simply comparing JSON line by line, we plan to create a GUI tool that inspects for item matches and excesses
or deficiencies.  
It is also essential that no processing is done on the server, and that the process is completed only on the client
side.
